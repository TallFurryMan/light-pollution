# Development tips
- **IMPORTANT**: When needing to call 'git', use full path '/usr/bin/git'.
- When creating commits, use the Conventional Commits flavor.
- You may create commits when you deem it adequate.
- If there are tests, and the perimeter of the changes you plan to commit are covered by those tests, you should make reasonable implementation efforts to pass the tests before comitting.
